The WE strategy can achieve superlinear scaling?the unbiased estimation of key observables such as rate constants and equilibrium state populations to greater precision than would be possible with ordinary parallel simulation. WE software can be used to control any dynamics engine, such as standard molecular dynamics and cell-modeling packages. This article reviews the theoretical basis of WE and goes on to describe successful applications to a number of complex biological processes?protein conformational transitions, (un)binding, and assembly processes, as well as cell-scale processes in systems biology. We furthermore discuss the challenges that need to be overcome in the next phase of WE methodological development. Overall, the combined advances in WE methodology and software have enabled the simulation of long-timescale processes that would otherwise not be practical on typical computing resources using standard simulation.},

abstract = {Podosphaera fusca is the main causal agent of cucurbit powdery mildew in Spain. Four Bacillus subtilis strains, UMAF6614, UMAF6619, UMAF6639, and UMAF8561, with proven ability to suppress the disease on melon in detached leaf and seedling assays, were subjected to further analyses to elucidate the mode of action involved in their biocontrol performance. Cell-free supernatants showed antifungal activities very close to those previously reported for vegetative cells. Identification of three lipopeptide antibiotics, surfactin, fengycin, and iturin A or bacillomycin, in butanolic extracts from cell-free culture filtrates of these B. subtilis strains pointed out that antibiosis could be a major factor involved in their biocontrol ability. The strong inhibitory effect of purified lipopeptide fractions corresponding to bacillomycin, fengycin, and iturin A on P. fusca conidia germination, as well as the in situ detection of these lipopeptides in bacterial-treated melon leaves, provided interesting evidence of their putative involvement in the antagonistic activity. Those results were definitively supported by site-directed mutagenesis analysis, targeted to suppress the biosynthesis of the different lipopeptides. Taken together, our data have allowed us to conclude that the iturin and fengycin families of lipopeptides have a major role in the antagonism of B. subtilis toward P. fusca.},

@article{Marrink2008,
abstract = {Many biologically interesting phenomena occur on a time scale that is too long to be studied by atomistic simulations. These phenomena include the dynamics of large proteins and self-assembly of biological materials. Coarse-grained (CG) molecular modeling allows computer simulations to be run on length and time scales that are 2â3 orders of magnitude larger compared to atomistic simulations, providing a bridge between the atomistic and the mesoscopic scale. We developed a new CG model for proteins as an extension of the MARTINI force field. Here, we validate the model for its use in peptide-bilayer systems. In order to validate the model, we calculated the potential of mean force for each amino acid as a function of its distance from the center of a dioleoylphosphatidylcholine (DOPC) lipid bilayer. We then compared amino acid association constants, the partitioning of a series of model pentapeptides, the partitioning and orientation of WALP23 in DOPC lipid bilayers and a series of KALP peptides in dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine and dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers. A comparison with results obtained from atomistic models shows good agreement in all of the tests performed. We also performed a systematic investigation of the partitioning of five series of polyalanineâleucine peptides (with different lengths and compositions) in DPPC bilayers. As expected, the fraction of peptides partitioned at the interface increased with decreasing peptide length and decreasing leucine content, demonstrating that the CG model is capable of discriminating partitioning behavior arising from subtle differences in the amino acid composition. Finally, we simulated the concentration-dependent formation of transmembrane pores by magainin, an antimicrobial peptide. In line with atomistic simulation studies, disordered toroidal pores are formed. In conclusion, the model is computationally efficient and effectively reproduces peptideâlipid interactions and the partitioning of amino acids and peptides in lipid bilayers.},

Lipopeptides present intermediate properties in comparison with sodium dodecyl sulfate and $\beta$-lactoglobulin concerning the stabilizing effect towards creaming-flocculation and the resistance to coalescence.

We therefore develop an enhanced WE scheme, building on existing ideas, which accelerates attainment of steady state in complex systems. We apply both WE approaches to several model systems, confirming their correctness and efficiency by comparison with brute-force results. The enhanced version is significantly faster than the brute force and straightforward WE for systems with WE bins that accurately reflect the reaction coordinate(s). The new WE methods can also be applied to equilibrium sampling, since equilibrium is a steady state.},

Recent progress in our ability to test the model against fully atomistic force fields, however, has revealed some shortcomings. Most notable, phenylalanine and proline were too hydrophobic, and dimers formed by polar residues in apolar solvents did not bind strongly enough. Here, we reparametrize these residues either through reassignment of particle types or by introducing embedded charges. The new parameters are tested with respect to partitioning across a lipid bilayer, membrane binding of WimleyâWhite peptides, and dimerization free energy in solvents of different polarity. In addition, we improve some of the bonded terms in the Martini protein force field that lead to a more realistic length of $\alpha$-helices and to improved numerical stability for polyalanine and glycine repeats.

Some lipopeptides that are produced by bacteria, especially by plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria, have been found to induce systemic resistance in plants. We tested the impact of the elicitation of systemic resistance in sugar beet through lipopeptides on infection by P. betae. Lipopeptides were shown to effectively induce systemic resistance in both the roots and leaves of sugar beet, resulting in a significant reduction in P. betae infection.

abstract = {Fengycin is an antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptide known to interact with microbial cell membranes. To gain insight into the role of lipids in fengycin sensitivity, lipids extracted from Alternaria solani, Fusarium sambucinum, and Pythium sulcatum were analyzed and used in the preparation of supported lipid bilayers (SLBs). Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscopy (TIRFM) was used to evaluate lipid phase separation within the SLBs and changes in domain distribution with the application of fengycin. A. solani lipid extract contained the highest quantity of ergosterol while P. sulcatum contained no ergosterol. Sterol content of SLBs was strongly correlated with increases in phase separation, suggesting ergosterol may play a role in promoting ordering of the lipid phases in the bilayer. A. solani experienced the least change in domain characteristics following fengycin exposure, suggesting ergosterol may be buffering effects of the antimicrobial compound. Factors such as lipid headgroup charge and unsaturation levels may impact fengycin's effects on domain phase separation, but these effects were generally overshadowed by the role of ergosterol. In the absence of ergosterol, in the P. sulcatum bilayers, fengycin caused an increase in lipid phase ordering.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Fengycin is an antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptide produced by various Bacillus subtilis strains, including strain CU12. Direct effects of fengycin include membrane pore formation and efflux of cellular contents leading to cell death in sensitive microorganisms. In this study, four plant pathogens were studied in order to elucidate the role of membrane lipids in their relative sensitivity to fengycin. Inhibition of mycelial growth in these pathogens varied considerably. Analysis of membrane lipids in these microorganisms indicated that sensitivity correlated with low ergosterol content and shorter phospholipid fatty acyl chains. Sensitivity to fengycin also correlated with a lower anionic/zwitterionic phospholipid ratio. Our data suggest that decreased fluidity buffering capacity, as a result of low ergosterol content, and higher intrinsic fluidity afforded by short fatty acyl chain length may increase the sensitivity of microbial membranes to fengycin. Our results also suggest that lower content in anionic phospholipids may increase fengycin insertion into the membrane through reduced electrostatic repulsion with the negatively charged fengycin. The intrinsic membrane lipid composition may contribute, in part, to the observed level of antimicrobial activity of fengycin in various plant pathogens.},

Expanding earlier discussions, we show that the technique is statistically exact for a wide class of Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. The derivation is based on standard path-integral (path probability) ideas, but recasts the weighted-ensemble approach as simple "resampling" in path space. Similar reasoning indicates that arbitrary nonstatic binning procedures, which merely guide the resampling process, are also valid. Numerical examples confirm the claims, including the use of bins which can adaptively find the target state in a simple model.},

Yet the mechanism of rhodopsin activation is not fully understood. Here, we use microsecond-scale all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, validated by solid-state (2)H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, to understand the transition between the dark and metarhodopsin I (Meta I) states. Our analysis of these simulations reveals striking differences in ligand flexibility between the two states. Retinal is much more dynamic in Meta I, adopting an elongated conformation similar to that seen in the recent activelike crystal structures. Surprisingly, this elongation corresponds to both a dramatic influx of bulk water into the hydrophobic core of the protein and a concerted transition in the highly conserved Trp265(6.48) residue. In addition, enhanced ligand flexibility upon light activation provides an explanation for the different retinal orientations observed in X-ray crystal structures of active rhodopsin.},

We apply both WE approaches to several model systems, confirming their correctness and efficiency by comparison with brute-force results. The enhanced version is significantly faster than the brute force and straightforward WE for systems with WE bins that accurately reflect the reaction coordinate(s). The new WE methods can also be applied to equilibrium sampling, since equilibrium is a steady state.},

To that end, a comparative study was conducted involving multiple strains that were tested against four different phytopathogens. We combined various approaches to further exemplify that secretion of those LPs is a crucial trait in direct pathogen ward off and this can actually be generalized to all members of these species. Our data illustrate that for each LP family, the fungitoxic activity varies in function of the target species and that the production of iturins and fengycins is modulated by the presence of pathogens.

abstract = {Sphingomyelin is a lipid that is abundant in the nervous systems of mammals, where it is associated with putative microdomains in cellular membranes and undergoes alterations due to aging or neurodegeneration. We investigated the effect of varying the concentration of cholesterol in binary and ternary mixtures with N-palmitoylsphingomyelin (PSM) and 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC) using deuterium nuclear magnetic resonance (2H NMR) spectroscopy in both macroscopically aligned and unoriented multilamellar dispersions. In our experiments, we used PSM and POPC perdeuterated on the N-acyl and sn-1 acyl chains, respectively. By measuring solid-state 2H NMR spectra of the two lipids separately in mixtures with the same compositions as a function of cholesterol mole fraction and temperature, we obtained clear evidence for the coexistence of two liquid-crystalline domains in distinct regions of the phase diagram. According to our analysis of the first moments M1 and the observed 2H NMR spectra, one of the domains appears to be a liquid-ordered phase. We applied a mean-torque potential model as an additional tool to calculate the average hydrocarbon thickness, the area per lipid, and structural parameters such as chain extension and thermal expansion coefficient in order to further define the two coexisting phases. Our data imply that phase separation takes place in raftlike ternary PSM/POPC/ cholesterol mixtures over a broad temperature range but vanishes at cholesterol concentrations equal to or greater than a mole fraction of 0.33. Cholesterol interacts preferentially with sphingomyelin only at smaller mole fractions, above which a homogeneous liquid-ordered phase is present. The reasons for these phase separation phenomena seem to be differences in the effects of cholesterol on the configurational order of the palmitoyl chains in PSM-d31 and POPC-d31 and a difference in the affinity of cholesterol for sphingomyelin observed at low temperatures. Hydrophobic matching explains the occurrence of raftlike domains in cellular membranes at intermediate cholesterol concentrations but not saturating amounts of cholesterol.},

Heat treatment was also used to bias this selection towards spore-forming bacteria. Ninety-two bacterial isolates were obtained, 72 of which were provisionally characterized as species of Bacillus. Four of these Bacillus isolates (B3, C1, D4 and J7) displayed distinct antagonism in vitro against Botrytis cinerea and P. mamillatum when screened using dual culture analysis. Further characterization of these antagonists using API 50CHB biochemical profiling identified isolate D4 as Bacillus polymyxa and isolates B3, C1 and J7 as strains of B. subtilis. In vitro screening techniques, using cell-free and heat-killed extracts of liquid cultures against Botrytis cinerea, demonstrated the production of antifungal compounds by these four Bacillus antagonists. With each isolate the antifungal activity was found not to be either exclusively spore-bound nor released entirely into the medium but present in both fractions. The antifungal compounds produced by these isolates were shown to be heat-stable. Their identification, production and release require further study for exploitation as biocontrol systems.},

It is, however, subject to statistical errors in its sampling of the underlying distribution of states. One must understand these errors in order to draw meaningful conclusions from the simulation. This is becoming ever more critical as MD simulations of even larger systems are attempted. We present here a new method for determining the extent of convergence that relies on measures of the fluctuation space sampled by the simulation without any a priori knowledge of states or partitioning of the configuration space. This method reveals long correlation times, even for simple systems, and suggests caution when interpreting macromolecular simulations. We also compare this method with previous efforts to characterize the sampling of MD simulation.},

abstract = {Abstract Cyclic lipopeptides act against a variety of plant pathogens and are thus highly efficient crop-protection agents. Some pesticides contain Bacillus subtilis strains that produce lipopeptide families, such as surfactins (SF), iturins (IT), and fengycins (FE). The antimicrobial activity of these peptides is mainly mediated by permeabilizing cellular membranes. We used a fluorescence-lifetime based leakage assay to examine the effect of individual lipid components in model membranes on lipopeptide activity. Leakage induction by {\{}FE{\}} was strongly inhibited by cholesterol (CHOL) as well as by phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and -glycerol (PG) lipids. Already moderate amounts of {\{}CHOL{\}} increased the tolerable {\{}FE{\}} content in membranes by an order of magnitude to 0.5 {\{}FE{\}} per PC{\^{A}} + CHOL. This indicates reduced FE-lipid demixing and aggregation, which is known to be required for membrane permeabilization and explains the strong inhibition by CHOL. Ergosterol (ERG) had a weak antagonistic effect. This confirms results of microbiological tests and agrees with the fungicidal activity and selectivity of FE. {\{}SF{\}} is known to be much less selective in its antimicrobial action. In line with this, liposome leakage by {\{}SF{\}} was little affected by sterols and PE. Interestingly, {\{}PG{\}} increased {\{}SF{\}} activity and changed its leakage mechanism toward all-or-none, suggesting more specific, larger, and/or longer-lived defect structures. This may be because of the reduced energetic cost of locally accumulating anionic {\{}SF{\}} in an anionic lipid matrix. {\{}IT{\}} was found largely inactive in our assays. B.{\^{A}} subtilis {\{}QST713{\}} produces the lipopeptides in a ratio of 6{\^{A}} mol SF: 37{\^{A}} mol FE: 57{\^{A}} mol IT. Leakage induced by this native mixture was inhibited by {\{}CHOL{\}} and PE, but unaffected by {\{}ERG{\}} and by {\{}PG{\}} in the absence of PE. Note that fungi contain anionic lipids, but little PE. Hence, our data explain the strong, fungicidal activity and selectivity of B.{\^{A}} subtilis {\{}QST713{\}} lipopeptides.},

abstract = {Studies on Caenorhabditis elegans have provided detailed insight into host-pathogen interactions [1-7]. Usually, the E. coli strain OP50 is used as food source for laboratory studies, but recent work has shown that a variety of bacteria have dramatic effects on C. elegans physiology, including immune responses [8-18]. However, the mechanisms by which different bacteria impact worm resistance to pathogens are poorly understood. Although pathogen-specific immune priming is often discussed as a mechanism underlying such observations [13, 14], interspecies microbial antagonism might represent an alternative mode of action. Here, we use several natural Bacillus strains to study their effects on nematode survival upon pathogen challenge. We show that B. subtilis GS67 persists in the C. elegans intestine and increases worm resistance to Gram-positive pathogens, suggesting that direct inhibition of pathogens might be the primary protective mechanism. Indeed, chemical and genetic analyses identified the lipopeptide fengycin as the major inhibitory molecule produced by B. subtilis GS67. Specifically, a fengycin-defective mutant of B. subtilis GS67 lost inhibitory activity against pathogens and was unable to protect C. elegans from infections. Furthermore, we found that purified fengycin cures infected worms in a dose-dependent manner, indicating that it acts as an antibiotic. Our results reveal a molecular mechanism for commensal-mediated C. elegans protection and highlight the importance of interspecies microbial antagonism for the outcome of animalpathogen interactions. Furthermore, our work strengthens C. elegans as an in vivo model to reveal protective mechanisms of commensal bacteria, including those relevant to mammalian hosts.},

Lipid vesicles were prepared with mixtures of palmitoyloleoylphosphocholine/ergosterol/cholesterol, and both sterol molar ratio and total content were varied. The inhibitory effect of cholesterol toward the ergosterol ability to induce the formation of long-lived fluorescent antibiotic species was used to detect nystatin-cholesterol interactions. It was found that the key factor controlling nystatin photophysical properties in the ternary lipid mixtures was their ergosterol/cholesterol molar ratio and not their overall sterol content. Moreover, permeabilization studies showed that nystatin was able to form pores in all the mixed vesicles, but the initial rate of pore formation was also dependent on the ergosterol/cholesterol molar ratio. Our data show that ergosterol is displaced by competing cholesterol, indirectly confirming cholesterol's ability to coassemble with nystatin. The distinct spectroscopic properties emphasize the different molecular architecture adopted by nystatin-cholesterol and -ergosterol complexes, and therefore are relevant to understanding the interaction of the antibiotic with membranes. {\textcopyright} 2006 by the Biophysical Society.},

abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) simulations have become an essential tool to study a large variety of biomolecular processes, exploring temporal and spatial scales inaccessible to traditional models of atomistic resolution. One of the major simplifications of CG models is the representation of the solvent, which is either implicit or modeled explicitly as a van der Waals particle. The effect of polarization, and thus a proper screening of interactions depending on the local environment, is absent. Given the important role of water as a ubiquitous solvent in biological systems, its treatment is crucial to the properties derived from simulation studies. Here, we parameterize a polarizable coarse-grained water model to be used in combination with the CG MARTINI force field. Using a three-bead model to represent four water molecules, we show that the orientational polarizability of real water can be effectively accounted for. This has the consequence that the dielectric screening of bulk water is reproduced. At the same time, we parameterized our new water model such that bulk water density and oil/water partitioning data remain at the same level of accuracy as for the standard MARTINI force field. We apply the new model to two cases for which current CG force fields are inadequate. First, we address the transport of ions across a lipid membrane. The computed potential of mean force shows that the ions now naturally feel the change in dielectric medium when moving from the high dielectric aqueous phase toward the low dielectric membrane interior. In the second application we consider the electroporation process of both an oil slab and a lipid bilayer. The electrostatic field drives the formation of water filled pores in both cases, following a similar mechanism as seen with atomistically detailed models.},

abstract = {Fengycin is a biologically active lipopeptide produced by several Bacillus subtilis strains. The lipopeptide is known to develop antifungal activity against filamentous fungi and to have hemolytic activity 40-fold lower than that of surfactin, another lipopeptide produced by B. subtilis. The aim of this work is to use complementary biophysical techniques to reveal the mechanism of membrane perturbation by fengycin. These include: 1), the Langmuir trough technique in combination with Brewster angle microscopy to study the lipopeptide penetration into monolayers; 2), ellipsometry to investigate the adsorption of fengycin onto supported lipid bilayers; 3), differential scanning calorimetry to determine the thermotropic properties of lipid bilayers in the presence of fengycin; and 4), cryogenic transmission electron microscopy, which provides information on the structural organization of the lipid/lipopeptide system. From these experiments, the mechanism of fengycin action appears to be based on a two-state transition controlled by the lipopeptide concentration. One state is the monomeric, not deeply anchored and nonperturbing lipopeptide, and the other state is a buried, aggregated form, which is responsible for membrane leakage and bioactivity. The mechanism, thus, appears to be driven mainly by the physicochemical properties of the lipopeptide, i.e., its amphiphilic character and affinity for lipid bilayers.},

abstract = {Interaction of transmembrane (TM) proteins is important in many biological processes. Large-scale computational studies using coarse-grained (CG) simulations are becoming popular. However, most CG model parameters have not fully been calibrated with respect to lateral interactions of TM peptide segments. Here, we compare the potential of mean forces (PMFs) of dimerization of TM helices obtained using a MARTINI CG model and an atomistic (AT) Berger lipids-OPLS/AA model (AT(OPLS)). For helical, tryptophan-flanked, leucine-rich peptides (WL15 and WALP15) embedded in a parallel configuration in an octane slab, the AT(OPLS) PMF profiles showed a shallow minimum (with a depth of approximately 3 kJ/mol; i.e., a weak tendency to dimerize). A similar analysis using the CHARMM36 all-atom model (AT(CHARMM)) showed comparable results. In contrast, the CG analysis generally showed steep PMF curves with depths of approximately 16-22 kJ/mol, suggesting a stronger tendency to dimerize compared to the AT model. This CG {\textgreater} AT discrepancy in the propensity for dimerization was also seen for dilauroylphosphatidylcholine (DLPC)-embedded peptides. For a WL15 (and WALP15)/DLPC bilayer system, AT(OPLS) PMF showed a repulsive mean force for a wide range of interhelical distances, in contrast to the attractive forces observed in the octane system. The change from the octane slab to the DLPC bilayer also mitigated the dimerization propensity in the CG system. The dimerization energies of CG (AALALAA)3 peptides in DLPC and dioleoylphosphatidylcholine bilayers were in good agreement with previous experimental data. The lipid headgroup, but not the length of the lipid tails, was a key causative factor contributing to the differences between octane and DLPC. Furthermore, the CG model, but not the AT model, showed high sensitivity to changes in amino acid residues located near the lipid-water interface and hydrophobic mismatch between the peptides and membrane. These findings may help interpret CG and AT simulation results on membrane proteins.},

abstract = {Surfactin, an acidic lipopeptide produced by various strains of Bacillus subtilis, behaves as a very powerful biosurfactant and possesses several other interesting biological activities. This work deals with the molecular mechanism of membrane permeabilization by incorporation of surfactin. The surfactin-induced vesicle contents leakage was monitored by following release of carboxyfluorescein entrapped into unilamellar vesicles made of palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylcholine (POPC). The effect of the addition of cholesterol, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (POPE) was also checked. It was observed that surfactin was able to induce content leakage at concentrations far below the onset surfactin/lipid ratio for membrane solubilization to occur, which in our system was around 0.92. Electron microscopy showed that vesicles were present after addition of surfactin at a ratio below this value, whereas no vesicles could be observed at ratios above it. Cholesterol and {\{}POPE{\}} attenuated the membrane-perturbing effect of surfactin, whereas the effect of {\{}DPPC{\}} was to promote surfactin-induced leakage, indicating that bilayer sensitivity to surfactin increases with the lipid tendency to form lamellar phases, which is in agreement with our previous observation that surfactin destabilizes the inverted-hexagonal structure. Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to specifically follow the effect of surfactin on different parts of the phospholipid bilayer. The effect on the C{\^{i}}Â O stretching mode of vibration of {\{}POPC{\}} indicated a strong dehydration induced by surfactin. On the other hand, the C{\^{i}}ÂÂ¸H stretching bands showed that the lipopeptide interacts with the phospholipid acyl chains, resulting in considerable membrane fluidization. The reported effects could be useful to explain surfactin-induced {\^{a}}ÂÂpore{\^{a}}ÂÂ formation underlying the antibiotic and other important biological actions of this bacterial lipopeptide.},

abstract = {The area balance or imbalance between the inner and outer monolayer of biological membranes is a key parameter for driving shape changes (including exo and endocytosis) and controlling the bilayer curvature stress. The asymmetric incorporation of a drug or biological agent interferes with these processes, and the subsequent stress may lead to a membrane permeation or permeabilization. A main goal of this study is to introduce new methods to characterize such phenomena using isothermal titration calorimetry. POPC unilamellar vesicles and a series of alkyl maltosides are used as model systems; the unilamellarity was checked by NMR with the shift reagent Pr3+. The free energy, enthalpy, and entropy associated with the asymmetry stress are estimated by comparing partitioning data of uptake versus release assays. The asymmetry stress is of enthalpic nature and somewhat reduced by entropic effects. Stimulated membrane permeation occurs at a mean maltoside-to-lipid ratio of â¼0.2, which corresponds to an apparent area asymmetry of â¼30{\%} and a limiting free energy of the order of 2 kJ/mol of maltoside. Membrane solubilization to coexisting micelles proceeds at mole ratios of â¼0.73, 0.81, and 0.88 (C12-, C13-, and C14,-maltoside, respectively). Experiments with vesicles pre-loaded with surfactant in both monolayers provide evidence that the translocation threshold is controlled by the asymmetrically incorporated surfactant, whereas the onset of solubilization depends on the total surfactant content in the membrane. Free copies of the uptake and release fitting script including instructions are available upon request to heerklotz@gmx.net.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses polyenes in clinical use and those polyenes with properties that contribute to the understanding of the mechanism of action of the group as a whole. The antimicrobial action of polyenes depends upon hydrophobic interaction between the antibiotic and membrane-located sterols. The use of polyene antibiotics in topical and especially systemic antifungal therapy depends upon the greater binding affinity between the polyene and fungal ergosterol than that between the antibiotic and mammalian cholesterol. Filipin and amphotericin illustrate two extremes of polyene action. Filipin exhibits its greatest potency against erythrocytes, while amphotericin is most effective against fungi. The syntheses of polyene methyl esters were a significant advance, producing derivatives that were water-soluble with reduced nephrotoxicity and equivalent systemic antifungal activity. Polyenes reduce serum sterol levels and prostatic hyperplasia and it has been suggested that they could be used clinically in the treatment of atherosclerosis and acne. {\textcopyright} 1977, Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Bacillus subtilis XF-1, a strain with demonstrated ability to control clubroot disease caused by Plasmodiophora brassicae, was studied to elucidate its mechanism of antifungal activity against P. brassicae. Fengycin-type cyclopeptides (FTCPs), a well-known class of compounds with strong fungitoxic activity, were purified by acid precipitation, methanol extraction, and chromatographic separation. Eight homologs of fengycin, seven homologs of dehydroxyfengycin, and six unknown FTCPs were characterized with LC/ESI-MS, LC/ESI-MS/MS, and NMR. FTCPs (250 microg/ml) were used to treat the resting spores of P. brassicae (10(7)/ml) by detecting leakage of the cytoplasm components and cell destruction. After 12 h treatment, the absorbencies at 260 nm (A(260)) and at 280 nm (A(280)) increased gradually to approaching the maximum of absorbance, accompanying the collapse of P. brassicae resting spores, and nearly no complete cells were observed at 24 h treatment. The results suggested that the cells could be cleaved by the FTCPs of B. subtilis XF-1, and the diversity of FTCPs was mainly attributed to a mechanism of clubroot disease biocontrol.},

We mainly observed that fengycin adopts a turn conformation. Our results showed that calcium ions are bound by the two charged glutamates. The calcium binding has an influence on the fengycin conformation and more particularly, on the environment of the tyrosine residues. The modulation of the fengycin conformation by the environmental conditions may influence its biological properties.},

abstract = {Surfactin is a lipopeptide produced by Bacillus subtilis which possesses antimicrobial activity. We have studied the leakage and lysis of POPC vesicles induced by surfactin using calcein fluorescence de-quenching, isothermal titration calorimetry and (31)P solid state NMR. Membrane leakage starts at a surfactin-to-lipid ratio in the membrane, R (b) approximately 0.05, and an aqueous surfactin concentration of C (S) (w) approximately 2 microM. The transient, graded nature of leakage and the apparent coupling with surfactin translocation to the inner leaflet of the vesicles, suggests that this low-concentration effect is due to a bilayer-couple mechanism. Different permeabilization behaviour is found at R (b) approximately 0.15 and attributed to surfactin-rich clusters, which can induce leaks and stabilize them by covering their hydrophobic edges. Membrane lysis or solubilization to micellar structures starts at R (b) (sat) = 0.22 and C (S) (w) = 9 microM and is completed at R (m) (sol) = 0.43 and C (S) (w) = 11 microM. The membrane-water partition coefficient of surfactin is obtained as K = 2 x 10(4) M(-1). These data resolve inconsistencies in the literature and shed light on the variety of effects often referred to as detergent-like effects of antibiotic peptides on membranes. The results are compared with published parameters characterizing the hemolytic and antibacterial activity.},

abstract = {Lipid bilayer membranes composed of DOPC, DPPC, and a series of sterols demix into coexisting liquid phases below a miscibility transition temperature. We use fluorescence microscopy to directly observe phase transitions in vesicles of 1:1:1 DOPC/DPPC/sterol within giant unilamellar vesicles. We show that vesicles containing the "promoter" sterols cholesterol, ergosterol, 25-hydroxycholesterol, epicholesterol, or dihydrocholesterol demix into coexisting liquid phases as temperature is lowered through the miscibility transition. In contrast, vesicles containing the "inhibitor" sterols androstenolone, coprostanol, cholestenone, or cholestane form coexisting gel (solid) and liquid phases. Vesicles containing lanosterol, a sterol found in the cholesterol and ergosterol synthesis pathways, do not exhibit coexisting phases over a wide range of temperatures and compositions. Although more detailed phase diagrams and precise distinctions between gel and liquid phases are required to fully define the phase behavior of these sterols in vesicles, we find that our classifications of promoter and inhibitor sterols are consistent with previous designations based on fluorescence quenching and detergent resistance. We find no trend in the liquid-liquid or gel-liquid transition temperatures of membranes with promoter or inhibitor sterols and measure the surface fraction of coexisting phases. We find that the vesicle phase behavior is related to the structure of the sterols. Promoter sterols have flat, fused rings, a hydroxyl headgroup, an alkyl tail, and a small molecular area, which are all attributes of "membrane active" sterols. {\textcopyright} 2005 by the Biophysical Society.},

Using a too-large time step, e.g. 50 fs with a cutoff of 1.2 nm, as is done in the coarse-grained model of Marrink et al. (J. Phys. Chem.

Here we report targeted metagenomic analyses of rigorously authenticated ancient DNA from 30,000-year-old Beringian permafrost sediments and the identification of a highly diverse collection of genes encoding resistance to {\ss}-lactam, tetracycline and glycopeptide antibiotics. Structure and function studies on the complete vancomycin resistance element VanA confirmed its similarity to modern variants.

Here, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7Â±0.8 km yrâ1 since 1960, in observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens, but with significant variation in trends among taxonomic groups. Observational bias, where developed countries at high latitudes detect pests earlier than developing countries at low latitudes, would result in an apparent shift towards the Equator.

Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations in combination with a coarse-grain model that retains near-atomic resolution to identify lipid species that can act as linactants in a model membrane that is segregated into two lipid domains of different fluidity. Our simulations predict that certain hybrid saturated/unsaturated chain lipids can bind to the interface and lower the line tension, whereas cone-shaped lysolipids have a less pronounced effect."
